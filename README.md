Tic tac toe
---
A classic board game created with *create-react-app*. See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md)
. It's the first step I've taken to learning how to build web apps and user interfaces using react.js and gain an overall understanding of react.js.
